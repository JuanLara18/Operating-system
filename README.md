# Operating Systems Course README
This is the repository for the Operating Systems course, which includes the materials for the labs and exams. The course will be based on the textbook "Operating System Concepts, 10th edition" by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne.

## Course Description
The Operating Systems course covers the fundamental concepts of operating systems and their implementation. The course will begin with an overview of operating systems and their history. We will then explore process management, memory management, input/output, file systems, and security. Throughout the course, we will discuss real-world examples of operating systems and their applications.

## Labs
There will be several labs throughout the course that will reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures. These labs will be hands-on, and students will have the opportunity to implement the concepts discussed in class. The labs will cover process management, memory management, and file systems.

## Exams
There will be two exams during the course: a midterm and a final. These exams will test the students' understanding of the course material, including the concepts discussed in the lectures and labs.

## Textbook
The textbook for the course is "Operating System Concepts, 10th edition" by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne. The textbook provides an in-depth look at operating systems and is a valuable resource for the course.
